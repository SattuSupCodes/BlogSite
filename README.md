Using Flask framework and creating a blog website 


## Installing Flask

`python3 -m venv env` creating a virtual environment

`venv\scripts\activate` activate the env

`pip install flask` install flask

## Features
A professional blog page for me as I love to write, but keeping the essence of a coder, i code it myself ;)

This webpage will have a dashboard for each user and a unique dashboard for me as I'm the author with the "post blog" option only.

I'll post and it will be automatically updated on the site for all users' dashboards who are logged into the system.

This is a work in progress and I'm super excited about it!





## Languages
I am working with python, sass css, html, and sql (SQLAlchemy)
